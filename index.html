                        Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out
                        to hoard and sell your most personal data. </p>
                    <p>
                        What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a
                        money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.</p>
                    <p>
                        But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it's simple: An autonomous peer-to-peer network
                        featuring distributed storage powered by universal
                        compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.</p>
                    <p>
                        Put even simpler — <b>it's the internet, completely decentralized.</b>
